Road safety remains a critical concern worldwide, with a significant portion of accidents attributed to driver drowsiness. 
In this context, I present a hardware project aimed at developing a Driver Drowsiness Detection system using ESP8266. 
The system incorporates IoT, cloud computing, and sensor technologies to monitor driver behavior and issue alerts when signs of drowsiness are detected.

Key components of the system include ESP8266 as the central processing unit, an eye blink sensor to capture relevant data, and a buzzer to alert the driver. 
The ESP8266 processes sensor data in real-time, deploying algorithms to identify patterns indicative of drowsiness, like prolonged eye closure.

Integration with cloud computing enables data transmission to a remote server for further analysis and alert generation. 
I have integrated the system with Blynk app which generates alert notifications on driver's phone upon detecting drowsiness.
Cloud-based processing enhances the system's capabilities, allowing for advanced data aggregation, visualization, and machine learning-based detection algorithms.

The project aims to contribute to road safety by providing an effective means of detecting driver drowsiness and issuing timely alerts to prevent accidents.
